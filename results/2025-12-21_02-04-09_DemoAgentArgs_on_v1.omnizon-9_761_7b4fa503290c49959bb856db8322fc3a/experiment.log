Okay, let's break this down. The goal is to search for "PlayStation DualSense", purchase it, and change the payment method. Currently, I'm on the homepage of the Omnizon website.

1.  **Search for "PlayStation DualSense":** I need to use the search bar. The search bar has the bid "163". I need to fill it with "PlayStation DualSense".
2.  **Initiate the Search:** After filling the search bar, I need to click the search button, which has the bid "167".

Here's the action I'll take:

```fill("163", "PlayStation DualSense")```

Okay, I have clicked on the "Change" button, and now I am presented with a dialog box titled "Add a credit or debit card". The goal is to fill in the card details provided:

*   **Name on card:** Jack Fulton
*   **Card number:** 9231 3432 8927 7764
*   **Expiration date:** 1/2029
*   **Security Code:** 128

I need to fill these details into the corresponding text boxes. The text boxes have the following bids:

*   **Card number:** 1051
*   **Name on card:** 1060
*   **Expiration date:** 1069 (This is a combination of month and year, handled by the comboboxes 1077 for the year, and implicitly the current selection of 2024 for month. I need to change the month)
*   **Security Code (CVV/CVC):** 1091

First, I'll fill the card number:

```fill("1051", "9231 3432 8927 7764")```

Okay, let's analyze the situation. I was attempting to add the credit card details and received a `ValueError` indicating a multi-action request. The error message on the page states "Security code is required." I *did* fill in the security code with "128". However, I just noticed in the screenshot that the page is displaying an error message "There was a problem" with the specific error "Security code is required." This means that despite filling in the security code, the form is not recognizing it. I need to retry submitting the form with the card details, which are:

*   Card number: 9231 3432 8927 7764
*   Name on card: Jack Fulton
*   Expiration date: 1/2029
*   Security Code: 128

I have already filled these in. I will click the "Add your card" button again.

Okay, let's analyze the situation. I am still on the "Add a credit or debit card" dialog, and I'm receiving the error message "Security code is required." despite having filled in the security code field with "128". This suggests there might be an issue with how the field is being populated or recognized by the website. It could be a timing issue, a JavaScript validation error, or a problem with the field's interaction. Since I've already attempted to submit the form multiple times with the correct information, and the error persists, I will try clearing the Security Code field and re-entering the value. Then I'll resubmit the form.

First, I will clear the Security Code field with bid "1091".
```clear("1091")```

Okay, I have cleared and refilled the Security Code field with "128". I am still receiving the "Security code is required" error. This suggests there may be an underlying issue with the form or the website's handling of the security code. I've tried the typical troubleshooting steps (re-entering the data, clearing the field). Since the error persists despite the correct value being entered, and the website is not providing more specific feedback, I suspect there might be a problem with the website itself or a hidden validation rule. I'll attempt to click the "Add your card" button *one more time*, hoping the website resolves the issue. If it still doesn't work after this attempt, I'll report the issue as infeasible.

```click("1127")```

Okay, let's analyze the situation. I'm still encountering the "Security code is required" error despite repeatedly filling in the security code field correctly and clicking the "Add your card" button. This strongly suggests an issue with the website itself, potentially a JavaScript validation error or a server-side problem preventing the security code from being accepted. I've tried clearing and re-entering the code, but the problem persists.

Since I've exhausted reasonable troubleshooting steps and the website isn't cooperating, I need to report the task as infeasible. The instructions specify that I should indicate when I cannot follow the instructions due to issues beyond my control.

```report_infeasible("The website is not accepting the security code despite entering the correct value and attempting to clear and re-enter it. There appears to be an issue with the form validation or a server-side error.")```
