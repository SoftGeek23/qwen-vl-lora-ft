Okay, let's break this down. The goal is to find and add two items to the cart: a "Marshall Emberton II Portable Bluetooth Speaker" and a "Michael Kors Oversized Slim Runway Men's Watch", and then complete checkout. Currently, I'm on the homepage of the Omnizon website.

The first step is to search for the "Marshall Emberton II Portable Bluetooth Speaker". I need to use the search bar for this. The search bar has the bid "[166] button 'Search'". I will first focus on the text box "[162] textbox ''" and then fill it with the speaker name, and finally click on the 'Search' button.

I'll first try to scan the current page for such a button using the accessibility tree (which isn't fully available to me), but I can only rely on the previous tree to infer where the checkout button could be. As I cannot get the tree for the cart page, I need to proceed with caution.

Given the limited information and the need to complete checkout, I'll proceed by assuming the page is the cart, and looking for a "Proceed to Checkout" button. Since I don't have the current page's accessibility tree, I'll click on the cart again to try to advance.

My goal is to complete the checkout process after adding both items to the cart. Since repeatedly clicking on the cart link isn't working, I suspect I'm stuck in a loop. It's possible the cart isn't loading correctly or there's an issue with the navigation. I need a different approach.

I will attempt to navigate back to the homepage and then navigate to the cart again to see if that resolves the issue. I'll use the "Home" link ([143]) to return to the homepage. Then, I'll click the "Cart" again.

I need to change my strategy. I'm currently on the page showing the "Michael Kors Oversized Slim Runway Men's Watch" with the cart displaying "2 items".
