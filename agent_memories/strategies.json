    "Execute only one action per turn. Never combine multiple actions in a single command as this will trigger a 'multi-action' error.",
    "If you encounter a ValueError about 'multi-action', review your action sequence to ensure you're not combining multiple operations in a single step.",
    "When working with dropdown-like elements for quantity or options selection, use click() to open the dropdown and then click() on the specific option rather than assuming it's a standard <select> element.",
    "Always use send_msg_to_user() to communicate findings, results, or information to the user, especially when the task involves retrieving and displaying product information or search results.",
    "When encountering element-not-found errors, implement a fallback strategy: try finding the element again, look for alternative elements, or consider if the page has changed.",
    "Use the appropriate interaction method based on element type: fill() for text inputs, click() for buttons and links, and clear() only for editable input fields.",
    "If a search doesn't return expected results, communicate this clearly to the user rather than continuing with incorrect assumptions.",
    "When reporting product information, structure the data with clear headings (Specifications, Features, Price, etc.) to enhance readability.",
    "Avoid repeated noop() actions when encountering challenges - instead, try alternative approaches or report specific limitations encountered.",
    "For dropdown interactions, first determine if the element is a true HTML <select>. If not, use a sequence of click() operations instead of select_option().",
    "When content is loading, use noop() with increasing durations (1000ms, then 2000ms) before determining a task is infeasible.",
    "Always use send_msg_to_user() to communicate findings to the user, especially when the task asks to 'find', 'display', or 'show' information.",
    "For product search and information tasks, follow a clear sequence: search \u2192 click product \u2192 extract details \u2192 send message to user.",
    "Stay focused on the original search query unless explicitly directed to change it. Changing search terms midway can lead to confusion and incomplete task execution.",
    "Format information shared with users using bullet points, clear headings, and organized structure for better readability.",
    "When asked to search for products or information on e-commerce sites, use the pattern: focus on search box \u2192 fill with search term \u2192 click search button",
    "After performing a search, always report your findings to the user using send_msg_to_user() with detailed information about what you found",
    "When reporting product information, include comprehensive specifications (name, model, key features) to help the user make informed decisions",
    "For product search tasks, understand that the goal is typically both finding the product AND communicating the results to the user",
    "When navigating through complex interfaces like Omnizon, follow established successful patterns exactly rather than experimenting with alternative approaches.",
    "Pay attention to significant jumps in element IDs (like 684 to 916), as these often indicate page transitions that require careful examination of the new state.",
    "For multi-step processes, maintain awareness of the complete sequence required and track your progress through each step.",
    "After completing what appears to be the main goal, look for a final confirmation or submission element to properly conclude the task.",
    "When a task takes multiple steps (9 steps in this example), be patient and methodical rather than trying to find shortcuts.",
    "When encountering 'Could not find element' errors, implement a progressive approach: first try waiting (noop), then verify the element selector, and finally look for alternative elements that serve the same purpose.",
    "If a specific element ID fails consistently, try to identify patterns in the IDs (e.g., sequential numbers like '455', '456') and adaptively try alternative IDs that match the pattern.",
    "Before interacting with elements on a newly loaded page, especially on e-commerce sites, use noop(1000) to ensure the page has fully loaded and all dynamic elements are rendered.",
    "After multiple failed attempts to find an element, consider taking a step back: re-examine the page state, check for navigation errors, or try an alternative approach to achieve the same goal.",
    "Always execute one action at a time and wait for the environment's response before proceeding to the next action, even for seemingly simple operations like searching.",
    "When interacting with web forms, follow a strict sequence pattern: focus on field \u2192 wait for response \u2192 fill the field \u2192 wait for response \u2192 click submit button.",
    "Break down complex interactions (like search) into their fundamental steps and execute each step individually, waiting for confirmation before proceeding.",
    "After encountering an error, modify your approach rather than repeating the same problematic action sequence.",
    "Always execute one action at a time, waiting for its completion before initiating the next action.",
    "Never repeat identical actions consecutively without verifying their results first - if an action appears to fail, try a different approach rather than immediately repeating it.",
    "For search interactions on e-commerce sites, follow the strict pattern: focus on search field \u2192 fill with query \u2192 click search button, with each step properly executed separately.",
    "After encountering an error, analyze what went wrong and modify your approach rather than attempting the same action pattern again.",
    "When interacting with elements by ID, confirm the element exists and is interactive before attempting the interaction."
