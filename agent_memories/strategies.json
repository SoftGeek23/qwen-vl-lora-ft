    "Execute only one action per turn. Never combine multiple actions in a single command as this will trigger a 'multi-action' error.",
    "Always execute one action at a time and wait for the environment's response before proceeding to the next action.",
    "Use the appropriate interaction method based on element type: fill() for text inputs, click() for buttons and links, and clear() only for editable input fields.",
    "Always use send_msg_to_user() to communicate findings, results, or information to the user.",
    "After encountering an error, modify your approach rather than repeating the same problematic action sequence.",
    "Avoid repeated noop() actions when encountering challenges - instead, try alternative approaches or report specific limitations encountered.",
    "When content is loading, use noop() with increasing durations (1000ms, then 2000ms) before determining a task is infeasible.",
    "For multi-step processes, maintain awareness of the complete sequence required and track your progress through each step.",
    "After completing what appears to be the main goal, look for a final confirmation or submission element to properly conclude the task.",
    "Format information shared with users using bullet points, clear headings, and organized structure for better readability."
