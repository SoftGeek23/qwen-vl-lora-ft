Break down complex operations into individual actions executed sequentially."}

Always first determine if the element is a true HTML <select> by attempting select_option(). If that fails, use a sequence of click() operations: first click to open the dropdown, then click on the desired option."}

First try waiting briefly (noop), then verify the element selector, look for alternative elements that serve the same purpose, or consider if the page has changed and requires re-examination of the current state."}

Each step should be executed individually, waiting for the environment response before proceeding."}
{"state_summary": "During search tasks, considering changing the search query midway through execution", "action": "Stay focused on the original search query unless explicitly directed to change it", "result": "success", "reflection": "Stay focused on the original search query unless explicitly directed to change it. Changing search terms midway can lead to confusion and incomplete task execution. If the initial search doesn't yield results, communicate this to the user rather than silently changing the query."}

Simply finding the product is not sufficient - the agent must use send_msg_to_user() to share the information."}

When element IDs change dramatically, the page structure has likely changed, and the agent should re-examine the current state before proceeding."}
{"state_summary": "Task takes multiple steps (9+ steps) to complete", "action": "Be patient and methodical rather than trying to find shortcuts", "result": "success", "reflection": "When a task takes multiple steps, be patient and methodical rather than trying to find shortcuts.

This prevents attempting to interact with elements before they're available, which can cause element-not-found errors."}
